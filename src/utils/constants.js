    question: "What is Blockchain technology, and how does it work",
    answer: `Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system where each transaction is verified across multiple computers in a secure way, making it impossible to hack or change.
It works by creating a continuous chain of blocks, each containing a record of the previous transaction.
The blockchain is secured via a consensus mechanism known as “mining,” where the nodes of the network are incentivized to validate transactions and create new blocks.
This makes it virtually impossible for anyone to tamper with the data stored on the blockchain, or to make unauthorized changes. Also, due to its distributed nature, there is no single point of failure.
That means if one node goes down, the other nodes will continue to operate without interruption.

    question:
      "How do I decide the best cryptocurrencies to trade in the 2024 crypto market?",
    answer: `When deciding which cryptocurrencies to trade, it is important to consider a range of factors. These include volatility, liquidity, market capitalization, and technological features.

Traders should also research the development team behind the coin or token and consider their past successes with other projects.

It's also very important to keep up with crypto market news when trying to identify crypto trading opportunities. And finally, always conduct thorough fundamental and technical analysis of cryptocurrency prices over several time frames before deciding when to enter or exit a trade.

    question: "Is Bitcoin a good cryptocurrency to trade?",
    answer: `Bitcoin is the most well-known and widely-used cryptocurrency. Its market capitalization is larger than all other crypto market caps combined.

It also has the highest level of liquidity, in addition to a robust infrastructure. This makes it the most popular cryptocurrency among traders and investors alike.

While Bitcoin does experience price volatility, it tends to be considered more stable than other, more volatile, digital currencies.

Ultimately, only you can determine whether or not Bitcoin is a good addition to your trading portfolio. It really depends on your own personal Bitcoin trading strategy and risk appetite.

As always, we recommend doing your own research and staying up to date with the latest crypto news before trading the crypto market.`,

    id: 5,
    question: "How do you deal with price gaps?",
    answer: `At Exness, we know how it feels when your pending order falls in a price gap, so it’s only fair that we guarantee no slippage for virtually all pending orders that are executed at least 3 hours after trading opens for an instrument. However, if your order meets any of the following criteria, it will be executed at the first market quote that follows the gap:

If your pending order is executed in market conditions that are not normal, such as during a period of low liquidity or high volatility.

If your pending order falls in a gap but the difference in pips between the first market quote (after the gap) and the requested price of the order is equal to or exceeds a certain number of pips (slippage-free range) for a particular instrument.

Slippage rule applies to specific trading instruments.`,

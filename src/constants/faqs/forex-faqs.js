    question: "What is leverage in forex trading?",
    firstanswer: `Leverage is essentially the ability to place trades with the use of borrowed capital. Your broker gives you a sort of loan to add to your funds, so you can use less of your own money, but still access larger trading positions.`,
    secondanswer: `When combined with a solid risk management strategy, leverage in forex can lead to greater returns from FX trading, because it makes capitalizing on smaller price movements more lucrative. But it can also lead to greater losses if you don't combine it with a well-thought-out risk management strategy.`,
    thirdanswer: `To avoid excess losses and increase your chances of higher returns, make sure you plan your risk strategy and maintain a sensible level of exposure before choosing your preferred leverage option.`,
